## Architecture

### Summary
Below diagram shows a high level view of application architecture:

As a web application user interacts with the web application. The User Interface is
composed of HTML pages, CSS for styling of the page and javascript on the client
side.The server side UI contains controllers and views. controllers are built using spark
framework, and views are built using Freemarker framework.

### Overview of User Interface
Game UI includes routes to different pages so that corresponding view templates are
generated.
Current game implementation includes Webserver, GetSignInRoute, GetSignOutRoute,
HomeController, PostSignInRoute and SignInController.

* Webserver:
This route initializes all the HTTP routes and each route can be called with respective
URLs.
